### About the Site

Daily Beer is a responsive, multi-page application where a user can search for beers based on an ABV value they input or search for breweries by inputting a city in the US. For this feature, I pulled from two third-party APIs, ( https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ & https://punkapi.com/ ), and I also created a REST API with preset beers on the beer list. Each route and the REST API were tested using Postman. The app follows the 7 RESTful routes abd demonstrates full CRUD by the beer list where a user can add, delete and edit beers.

### Future Changes

In the future, I would like to implement user auth so that each user would be able to have their own list rather than the shared one.
